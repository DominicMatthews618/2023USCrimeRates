2023 U.S. Crime Statistics Dashboard
This project analyzes 2023 crime statistics across all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., using data on total, violent, and non-violent offenses. I built an interactive Tableau dashboard that highlights state-by-state comparisons of crime rates per 100,000 residents, identifies national averages, and visualizes geographic crime patterns using filled maps and dynamic filters. Users can explore top 10 states by crime type, assess trends against national benchmarks, and uncover regional disparities with a parameter-driven interface. This project demonstrates the power of data storytelling and dashboard design for public safety insights and policy planning.
